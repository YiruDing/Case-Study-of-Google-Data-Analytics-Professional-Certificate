#### As a rider in Chicago with Cyclistic, the bike-share program, you might want to ask this question: 

# Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

To answer this question and complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project, here are the steps I will adopt:

## ask

As the title suggested, it's about how to make the casual riders the annual members. 

I would dig the incentive that the drivers purchase the membership by checking the distance of their riding and the most popular days.

## prepare

Because there are more than five million trip records per year, I did the data sampling by downloading the [Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data]( https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from January to September 2023 that has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 

## process

## analyze

## share

## act
