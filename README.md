# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project — Cyclistic bike share analysis

## Background

Originally based on the case study [“‘Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization”]( https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study) written by Kevin Hartman, the following analysis is to help a fictional company in Chicago, Cyclistic, featuring out how to convert casual riders(riders with single-ride or full-day pass) into annual members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno, The director of marketing, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. 

##  Business task 

Analyze rider's usage patterns for marketing membership conversion programs.

Tools: R, Google Sheets, BigQuery, and Tableau.

Dataset: Cyclistic’s historical trip data from October 2022 to September 2023(internal/first-party data provided as .csv spreadsheets)

## Process

###ask

This is the question asked: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

I would dig the incentive that drives the driver to purchase the membership by checking the distance of their riding, the most popular station, and the most popular day(s).
